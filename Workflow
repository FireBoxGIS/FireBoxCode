Proposed work: -decide surface classes 
                  -4+ dead, barren, manmade
               -decide test site final shape
                  -clipping to polygon extent, not perimeter.
               -preform classification in ENVI, ARCMAP
                  -create signiture test area, develop classification training?
               -consider DEM...conversion to numpy? slope raster?
               -create sample visualization
               
Completed:  -decide surface classes

              -clipping to polygon extent, not perimeter.
            -preform classification in ENVI, ARCMAP
               ********-create signiture test area, develop classification training?****
            -consider DEM...conversion to numpy? slope raster?
            -create sample visualization

Proposed work: -Explore other classification layers such as NDVI, NCLD
               -Get standard 3x3 focal window going
               -finalize base classification
               
Completed: -Very little.
           -Shadow correction on base classification completed.

Proposed work: -Go over all existing data to monitor cell size, projection, raster size etc.
               -Develop plan for days before presentation
               -Explore other classification layers such as NDVI, NLCD
               -Get focal window going
               
Completed work: -All existing layers normalized to same projection, cell size, extent and raster count.
                -plan developed for next 96 hrs
                -backup crutch solutions thought up for work till monday
                -discussion on where conditions regarding slope raster, passability of vehicles

Proposed work: -Rough out slides for presentations
               -Code some phase 0 data processing work
               
Completed work: -basic slides created, little content filled in
                -beginnings of phase 0 code created. Struggling with Error 000210 and GDB implementation.

Proposed work: -add to slides
               -complete the crutch solution, observing slope and class selection for areas that are open to ID passable zones
               -consider testing focal window and getting some nlcd data and such
               -cry deeply
